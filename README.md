# jsxphys
Markup language simple parser using JavaScript for x with the use of Physics

## Motivation
After reading some questions and answers [1-4], it triggers again a desire from the past in making a language for Physics that can accomodate equations, tables, figures, sounds, videos, and animations. We will not reinvent the wheel but use what has been already optimized or too complicated, e.g. equations will be handled by MathJax [5] (or later KaTeX? [6]). Tables will imitate markup from Markdown, but it still in the development stage, where it is still inefficient and the code is still complex.

Right now the social distancing and limitation policy in Bandung due to coronavirus pandemic [7] and other cities,  work from home (WFH) and study from home (SFH) require a lot of data transaction through internet which also be an additional cost to the students [8], since the use of online meeting application with sound and video. It would be better when only plain text is transmitted and then the rich content is created in user browser, this will save user bandwidth.

## Limitation
The jsxPhys will remain a client-side application to support users without complexity in installation as in a server-side application.
