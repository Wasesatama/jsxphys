# jsxphys
Markup language simple parser using JavaScript for x with the use of Physics

## Motivation
After reading some questions and answers [1-4], it triggers again a desire from the past in making a language for Physics that can accomodate equations, tables, figures, and animations. We will not reinvent the wheel but use what has been already optimized or too complicated, e.g. equations will be handled by MathJax [5] (or later KaTeX? [6]). Tables will imitate markup from Markdown, but it still in the development stage, where it is still inefficient and the code is still complex.

## Limitation
The jsxPhys will remain a client-side application to support users without complexity in installation as in a server-side application.
