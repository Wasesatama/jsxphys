# Version 0.0.2
This version is migrated from the personal project xPhysics chapter 92, where it is still in JavaScript code and not really a markup document. It uses [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax) for equations and [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs) for xy scatter charts. An editor side-by-side with its output is made by `textarea` and `p`, two of the HTML DOM element objects. Charts are not with caption and reference.

# Note
This README is written using [Markdown Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here).
